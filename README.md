# Notes-App
I have created a notes app using android studio in which user is able to store daily essential notes. User can easily add notes by only one click. User can also add the image as note. This app helps user to remember daily essential things like user can add important account passwords, monthly bills dates, grocery items list etc. This app shows the notes according to date at which it created. Users can also update and delete notes according to his/her needs. User also add title of the note to better remember his/her notes. User can share his/her note through various app like facebook, messenger, whatapp, twitter to other people.
